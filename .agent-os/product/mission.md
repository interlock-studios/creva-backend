# Product Mission

## Pitch

Creva is a creator workflow app that helps content creators seamlessly save, organize, and plan content from TikTok and Instagram by providing AI-powered video transcription, hook extraction, and content scheduling directly from social media videos.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Content Creators**: Active creators on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube who discover inspiration and want to organize ideas
- **Social Media Managers**: Professionals managing multiple accounts who need to save and schedule content ideas

### User Personas

**Aspiring Creator** (18-30 years old)
- **Role:** Content creator building their presence
- **Context:** Discovers inspiring content on social media, wants to learn from successful videos
- **Pain Points:** Hard to save ideas, can't read transcripts without rewatching, loses track of inspiration

**Professional Creator** (25-40 years old)
- **Role:** Full-time content creator with established following
- **Context:** Needs to research competitors and trends efficiently
- **Pain Points:** Wastes time rewatching videos, no central place for content ideas, manual transcript creation
- **Goals:** Quick access to transcripts, organized inspiration library, streamlined content planning

## The Problem

### Content Ideas Get Lost

Creators discover amazing content on social media but have no way to save and organize it effectively. Ideas get lost in likes, saved folders are unorganized, and there's no way to search or filter.

**Our Solution:** Save videos from TikTok and Instagram with automatic organization by topics, status tracking, and scheduling.

### Transcripts Are Essential But Missing

Creators need to read what was said in videos - to study hooks, understand scripts, and reference talking points. Currently they have to rewatch videos or manually transcribe.

**Our Solution:** AI-powered transcription that extracts full transcripts and identifies hooks automatically.

### Content Planning Is Fragmented

Creators use multiple tools to track ideas - notes apps, spreadsheets, calendar apps. There's no unified workflow from inspiration to execution.

**Our Solution:** Integrated calendar scheduling, status tracking (Planned → In Progress → Completed), and topic organization.

## Differentiators

### Instant Transcripts

Unlike other apps that just save links, Creva extracts the full transcript from every video. Creators can read hooks, study scripts, and search through transcripts.

### Hook Extraction

Creva automatically identifies the attention-grabbing opening lines (hooks) from videos. Creators can quickly scan and study what makes videos engaging.

### Creator-First Workflow

Built specifically for content creators with features like topic organization, content calendar, and status tracking. Not a generic bookmark tool.
