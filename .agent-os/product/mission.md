## The Problem

### Workout Content is Hard to Follow

Social media fitness content is inspiring but lacks the structure needed for effective workouts. Users watch a 30-second TikTok and struggle to remember the exercises, proper form, and progression. This leads to ineffective workouts and potential injury.

**Our Solution:** AI-powered video analysis that extracts workout details and creates comprehensive, personalized workout guides.

### No Guidance for Proper Form

Fitness videos on social platforms focus on entertainment over education, leaving users without proper form instruction or safety guidance. This creates barriers for beginners and increases injury risk.

**Our Solution:** Intelligent exercise recognition that provides detailed form cues, modifications, and safety tips for each movement.

### Disconnected Fitness Journey

Users discover great workout content but have no way to track progress, build routines, or create structured fitness programs from their social media discoveries.

**Our Solution:** Seamless integration that transforms social content into trackable, progressive workout programs.

## Differentiators

Unlike traditional fitness apps that require manual workout entry, Sets AI integrates directly with social media sharing, allowing users to instantly convert any TikTok or Instagram workout into a structured guide with a single share action.

### AI-Powered Exercise Recognition

Unlike generic fitness apps, Sets AI uses advanced computer vision and AI to automatically identify exercises, count reps, analyze form, and provide personalized modifications based on the specific movements shown in social media content.
