# Product Mission (Lite)

Creva is a creator workflow app that helps content creators seamlessly save, organize, and plan content from TikTok and Instagram by providing AI-powered video transcription and hook extraction.

Creva serves content creators who discover inspiring videos on social media but struggle to organize and learn from them. Unlike generic bookmark tools, Creva automatically extracts full transcripts and hooks from saved videos, enabling creators to study successful content, organize ideas by topic, schedule content on a calendar, and track progress from inspiration to execution.
