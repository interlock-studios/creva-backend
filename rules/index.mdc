- Third-party SDK usage (RevenueCat, Superwall, Mixpanel)
- Image upload and storage
- Authentication flows
- Offline data handling

### Documentation & Process Rules

#### 5. [Cursor Rules](./cursor-rules.mdc)

## 🎯 Quick Reference

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Flutter 3.x
- **Language**: Dart 3.8+
- **State Management**: flutter_bloc (Cubit pattern)
- **Navigation**: go_router
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
- **AI Backend**: Cloud Run video parser API

### Key Services
1. **Firebase**: Authentication, Firestore database, Storage (fresh project for Creva)
2. **AI Backend**: TikTok/Instagram video parsing and transcription
3. **RevenueCat**: Subscription management
4. **Superwall**: Paywall optimization
5. **Mixpanel**: Product analytics
6. **AppsFlyer**: Attribution tracking

### Key Principles
- Clean architecture (domain/presentation separation)
- Immutable data models with freezed
- Repository pattern for data access
- Cubit for state management
- Never commit Firebase credentials
- Test on real devices
- User data isolation (Firestore security rules)
- **Code Quality**: Max 500 lines per file, modular structure, KISS principle
- **Generic Naming**: Use "video", "topic", "creator" terminology (avoid app name in code)

### Development Workflow
1. Read relevant rules before starting
2. Follow folder structure guidelines
3. Use Cubit for state management
4. Write clean, testable code
5. Test on both iOS and Android
6. Run `flutter analyze` before committing
7. Never commit secrets

## 🚀 Rule Application Order

1. **project-overview.mdc** - Read first for project context
2. **folder-structure.mdc** - Understand codebase organization
3. **code-style.mdc** - Apply to all Dart files
4. **api-integration.mdc** - Reference for Firebase/API work
5. **cursor-rules.mdc** - Set up development environment
6. **prd-creation.mdc** - Use when planning new features

## 📖 Getting Started

### For New Developers
1. **Read `../CLAUDE.md`** for complete project context
2. **Read `../AGENTS.md`** for Flutter development guidelines
3. **Read `../AI_CONTEXT.md`** for quick reference
4. Read `project-overview.mdc` for architecture details
5. Review `folder-structure.mdc` to understand organization
6. Follow `code-style.mdc` when writing code
7. Reference `api-integration.mdc` for Firebase operations

### For AI Assistants
1. Read `../AI_CONTEXT.md` first
2. Review `cursor-rules.mdc` for AI-specific guidelines
3. Follow `code-style.mdc` for code generation
4. Use `api-integration.mdc` for backend integration
5. Reference `prd-creation.mdc` when creating specs

## 🔑 Critical Rules

**NEVER**:
- Commit Firebase credentials (google-services.json, GoogleService-Info.plist)
- Use production API keys in development
- Skip Firestore security rules
- Import from wrong package names (use `package:creva/`)
- Create files over 500 lines (split into modules)
- Use app name "Creva" in code (use generic terms: video, topic, creator)

**ALWAYS**:
- Test on physical devices (iOS and Android)
- Run `flutter analyze` before commits
- Use Cubit for state management
- Follow clean architecture principles
- Validate user authentication before data access

## 📦 Project Context

**Creva** is a Flutter mobile app for creators to save, organize, and plan content from TikTok and Instagram. It helps creators capture ideas, review transcripts, organize by topics, schedule content, and track progress from idea to execution.

- Android: `com.interlock.creva` (TBD - update when Firebase project created)

**Key Features**:
- Save videos from TikTok/Instagram with source links
- Automatic transcription for hooks and scripts
- Organization by topics/projects
- Calendar scheduling
