# 🛡️ Edge Security Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to implement comprehensive cybersecurity checks at the Google Cloud Load Balancer level **before** requests reach your Cloud Run instances, preventing resource waste and improving security.

**Current Configuration:** Load balancer routes all traffic to **us-central1** (primary region only). Secondary regions are deployed but scaled to zero to minimize costs.

## Problem Solved ✅

**Bot requests to non-existent endpoints** like `/wp-admin`, `/phpmyadmin`, `/admin` were causing:
- ❌ Unnecessary Cloud Run instance spin-ups
- ❌ Resources wasted processing obvious 404/400 responses  
- ❌ Higher costs from handling invalid requests
- ❌ Performance impact from bot traffic

## Solution: Cloud Armor Edge Blocking

Now **bot traffic is blocked at the edge** before reaching instances:
- ✅ WordPress endpoints blocked (60% of bot traffic)
- ✅ Database admin tools blocked
- ✅ Generic admin endpoints blocked  
- ✅ Dangerous file extensions blocked
- ✅ DDoS protection with rate-based banning
- ✅ Geographic filtering (minimal impact)
- ✅ WAF rules for SQL injection, XSS, etc.

## Security Architecture

🌐 Global Load Balancer

🚀 Cloud Run Instances (Only legitimate traffic)
   • App Check Verification
   • Application-level Security
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Quick Setup (Recommended)

Use the Makefile command for easy setup:

```bash
# Setup Cloud Armor security policies with edge bot blocking
make setup-security
```

This will:
- Block WordPress endpoints (60% of bot traffic)
- Block database admin tools
- Block generic admin endpoints
- Block dangerous file extensions
- Add DDoS protection and WAF rules

### 2. Strict Allowlist Mode (deny-all except API endpoints)

Use this to ensure only valid API paths reach Cloud Run. Everything else is denied at edge.

```bash
# Apply strict allowlist policy (idempotent)
make setup-security-allowlist
```

Allowed by default:
- `/health`, `/health/*`
- `/status`, `/status/*`
- `/process`
- `/metrics/*`

Default rule: deny (403). Update the script in `scripts/setup/setup-cloud-armor-allowlist.sh` if you add new public endpoints.

### 3. Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# Run the Cloud Armor setup script
chmod +x ./scripts/setup/setup-cloud-armor.sh
./scripts/setup/setup-cloud-armor.sh

# Update your load balancer to use security policies
chmod +x ./scripts/setup/setup-global-lb-fixed.sh
./scripts/setup/setup-global-lb-fixed.sh
```

## Security Policies Implemented

## Monitoring & Alerts

### View Security Logs

```bash
# View Cloud Armor security events
make security-logs

# View recently blocked IPs
make blocked-ips

# Monitor in real-time
gcloud logging tail 'resource.type="http_load_balancer"' --format=json
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Blocked Requests**: Track attack attempts
2. **Geographic Blocks**: Monitor blocked countries
3. **Rate Limit Violations**: Identify abuse patterns
4. **WAF Triggers**: Common attack types

### Set Up Alerts

Create alerting policies for:
- High number of blocked requests (>100/hour)
- Geographic blocking spikes
- WAF rule triggers
- Rate limit violations

## Cost Savings

### Before (Application-level only)
- Attack traffic reaches Cloud Run instances
- Instances spin up to handle malicious requests
- Resources wasted on processing attacks
- Higher compute costs

### After (Edge-level filtering)
- 90%+ of attacks blocked at edge
- Only legitimate traffic reaches instances
- Significant cost reduction
- Better performance during attacks

## Performance Impact

- **Edge Filtering**: ~1-2ms latency (negligible)
- **Cost**: Cloud Armor pricing is minimal vs. compute savings
- **Scalability**: Handles massive attacks without affecting instances

## Security Policy Management

### Update Security Rules

```bash
# Add new geographic blocks
gcloud compute security-policies rules create 2100 \
    --security-policy=workout-parser-security-policy \
    --expression "origin.region_code == 'XX'" \
    --action=deny-403

# Update rate limits
gcloud compute security-policies rules update 1000 \
    --security-policy=workout-parser-security-policy \
    --rate-limit-threshold-count=150
```

### View Current Rules

```bash
gcloud compute security-policies describe workout-parser-security-policy \
    --format="table(rules[].priority,rules[].action,rules[].description)"
```

For the allowlist policy:
```bash
gcloud compute security-policies describe workout-parser-security-policy-allowlist \
    --format="table(rules[].priority,rules[].action,rules[].description)"
```

## Testing Security Policies

### Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# This should get blocked after 100 requests
for i in {1..150}; do
  curl -s https://api.setsai.app/health > /dev/null
  echo "Request $i sent"
done
```

### Test WAF Rules
```bash
# This should be blocked by SQL injection protection
curl "https://api.setsai.app/process?url=' OR 1=1--"
```

### Test Geographic Blocking
Use a VPN from blocked countries to verify blocking works.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Legitimate Traffic Blocked**
   - Check user agents in security logs
   - Adjust rate limits if too restrictive
   - Whitelist specific IPs if needed

2. **Security Policy Not Applied**
   - Verify policy is attached to backend service
   - Check load balancer configuration
   - Allow time for propagation (5-10 minutes)

3. **High False Positives**
   - Review WAF rule triggers
   - Adjust sensitivity levels
   - Create exception rules for legitimate patterns

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check security policy status
gcloud compute security-policies describe workout-parser-security-policy

# Verify policy attachment
gcloud compute backend-services describe workout-parser-backend-v2 --global

# View detailed security logs
gcloud logging read 'resource.type="http_load_balancer"' --limit=10 --format=json
```

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor Regularly**: Check security logs daily
2. **Adjust Thresholds**: Fine-tune based on legitimate traffic patterns  
3. **Geographic Considerations**: Be careful with broad country blocks
4. **Rate Limit Tuning**: Balance security vs. user experience
5. **Regular Updates**: Keep WAF rules current with threat landscape

## Integration with Application Security

Edge security **complements** your existing application-level security:

- **Edge**: Blocks obvious attacks and abuse
- **Application**: Handles business logic security (App Check, authentication)
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers provide comprehensive protection

## Load Balancer Configuration

### Current Setup: Single Region Routing
The load balancer is currently configured to route **all traffic to us-central1** (primary region only).

**Benefits:**
- 💰 **~95% cost reduction** - Secondary regions scale to zero when unused
- 🎯 **Simplified routing** - All traffic goes to one region
- 📊 **Easier monitoring** - Single region to track

**To update routing:**
```bash
# Update to single region (us-central1 only)
make update-lb-single-region

# To restore multi-region routing, re-run setup
make setup-lb-security
```

**Current backends:**
- ✅ **us-central1** (active, min-instances=1)
- ❌ us-east1 (removed from load balancer)
- ❌ europe-west1 (removed from load balancer)
- ❌ asia-southeast1 (removed from load balancer)

**Note:** Secondary region Cloud Run services remain deployed but will scale to zero since they receive no traffic. Cost: ~$1-2/month for Docker image storage only.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the security policies using `make setup-security`
2. Monitor security logs for the first week
3. Adjust rate limits based on legitimate traffic patterns
4. Set up alerting for security events
5. Regular security policy reviews and updates

---

**Result**: Malicious requests are now blocked at the edge, preventing unnecessary instance spin-ups and significantly reducing resource waste while maintaining robust security.
